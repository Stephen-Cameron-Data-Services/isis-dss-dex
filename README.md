Department of Social Services (Australia) Data Exchange via Apache Isis demo app 

The Department of Social Services (DSS) Data Exchange (DEX) is a reporting interface for programs funded by DSS. The Isis Chats app developed in a separate Github repository requires this reporting capability. I decided to do this as a separate standalone Apache Isis app, and integrate it with isis-chats via Isis View Models. 

Further information on DEX is available at [1].
